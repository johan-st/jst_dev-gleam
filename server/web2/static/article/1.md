leading: "I've fallen in love several times these last few years since I started writing code for a living. A few highlights are Docker, Elm, functional programming, Go, simple and portable file formats, my son, markdown, gleam and now NATS. Each infatuation has taught me something important about a technology and usually also about myself."

## In the beginning

Just like many of my adventures the last few years, it started with me reading the docs for some project I recently heard about. This time it was NATS. The more I read, the more I wanted to explore the patterns NATS and systems like it enable.

## Sadness ensues

When realizing how much of the backend can be replaced by a nats server I got a bit disheartened.. I enjoy writing go servers.. but maybe the sane choice is to use synadia and just add whatever pieces are not available there..  

For now I will use the nats server in my go application but I will probably offload a lot of logic to the client. [Gleam](https://gleam.run) really is a delightfull language to write!
