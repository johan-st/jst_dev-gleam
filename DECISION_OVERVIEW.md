# Architectural Decision Overview

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architectural migration options for transitioning from the current Go backend + Gleam frontend to a more unified and modern stack. Based on our analysis, we've identified several viable paths forward, each with distinct trade-offs and impacts.

## Current State

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Go server with HTTP API, WebSocket, NATS integration
- **Frontend**: Gleam/Lustre application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with direct access
- **Real-time**: WebSocket hub with NATS messaging
- **Deployment**: Fly.io with Docker

### Pain Points
- **Language Split**: Two different paradigms (imperative Go + functional Gleam)
- **Type Safety Gap**: No shared types between frontend and backend
- **Development Overhead**: Context switching between languages
- **API Contracts**: Manual validation and documentation
- **Real-time Complexity**: Manual WebSocket management

## Migration Options Analyzed

### 5. **Event-Driven Go**
**Status**: Incremental improvement to current stack

**Architecture**:
- Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event sourcing with NATS
- Enhanced real-time capabilities
- Improved separation of concerns

**Pros**:
- ✅ Leverages existing Go expertise

### 6. **Alternative Paths**
**Status**: Innovative but higher risk options

**Options**:
- **Rust Backend + Gleam Frontend**: Type safety with performance
- **TypeScript Frontend**: Easier hiring, massive ecosystem
- **Shared Schema Approach**: Type safety without full migration
- **Microservices Polyglot**: Best tool for each domain
- **WebAssembly Backend**: Code sharing between frontend/backend

**Impact**: Various trade-offs between innovation, risk, and specific benefits.
